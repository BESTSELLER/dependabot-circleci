`dependabot-circleci` is, as its name suggests, a small dependabot for CircleCI orbs and container images.
We have created this as at the time of creation it was nearly impossible to get changes into the official [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core).

---
<br/>

## Getting Started

1. Install the `dependabot-circleci` [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/dependabot-circleci) in your organization.
2. You enable `dependabot-circleci` on specific repositories by creating a `dependabot-circleci.yml` configuration file in your repository's `.github` directory. `dependabot-circleci` then raise pull requests to keep the dependencies you configure up-to-date.

<br/>

#### Example *dependabot-circleci.yml* file

The example *dependabot-circleci.yml* file below configures version updates. If it finds outdated dependencies, it will raise pull requests against the target branch to update the dependencies.

```yaml
# example dependabot-circleci.yml file

assignees:
  - github_username # for a single user
  - org/team_name # for a whole team (nested teams is the same syntax org/team_name)
labels:
  - label1
  - label2
reviewers:
  - github_username # for a single user
  - org/team_name # for a whole team (nested teams is the same syntax org/team_name)
target-branch: main
directory: "/.circleci/config.yml" # Folder where the circleci config files are located
schedule: "monthly" # Options are (daily, weekly, monthly)

```

dependabot-circleci will recursively scan all the files and folders in the directory specified in the `directory` field for CircleCI config files. If it finds any outdated dependencies, it will raise pull requests against the target branch specified in the `target-branch` field. dependabot-circleci will scan a maximum of 100 entities(folders or yaml/yml files).

## Configuration options for dependency updates

The `dependabot-circleci` configuration file, dependabot-circleci.yml, uses YAML syntax.
You must store this file in the .github directory of your repository.

## Contributing

We are open for issues, pull requests etc.

## Running locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure to have your secrets file in place
   2.1 BESTSELLER folks can use Harpocrates to get them from Vault.
      ```bash
      harpocrates -f secrets-local.yaml --vault-token $(vault token create -format=json | jq -r '.auth.client_token')
      ```
   2.2 Others will have to fill out this template in any other way.
      ```json
      {
        "datadog": {
          "api_key": ""
        },
        "github": {
          "app": {
            "integration_id": "",
            "private_key": "",
            "webhook_secret": ""
          },
          "oauth": {
            "client_id": "",
            "client_secret": ""
          },
          "v3_api_url": "https://api.github.com/"
        },
        "http": {
          "token": ""
        },
        "server": {
          "port": 3000,
          "public_url": ""
        },
        "bestseller_specific": {
          "token": ""
        }
      }
      ```
3. Run `dependabot-circleci` by using Docker compose
   > `--build` will ensure that the latest version of the code is used
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4. Test worker by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/worker` with the following payload
    ```bash
   curl --request POST \
   --url http://localhost:3000/start \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data '{"Org":"BESTSELLER","Repos": ["dependabot-circleci"]}'
   ```
5. If you want to debug the worker without docker:
   1. Add the env vars from the docker-compose file to your local environment to match the worker
   2. Run/Debug in your IDE with the `-worker` flag
